# Explainable_AI_for_Breastcancer_diagnosis
The project focuses on classifying benign and malignant cells using neural networks. As neural networks are often considered black box models, the emphasis is on interpreting the causality behind the classification. The goal is to create an explainable model, addressing the interpretability challenge associated with neural networks.
